# Brubeck!

The goal of Brubeck is to create a REPL for RISC-V assembly language -- a playground for learning, not a high performance emulator.

This is a _very_ early prototype. It is not interactive, and I'm just working on completing the RV32I instruction set.

Please follow this repo if you're interested in the project! I'm also very keen on feedback and thoughts on what you think would be awesome to see in a RISC-V assembly playground.
