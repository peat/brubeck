# Brubeck!

The goal of Brubeck is to create a REPL for RISC-V assembly language, and a very easy to use emulator library -- a playground for learning, not a high performance emulator.

This is a _very_ early prototype. See the [brubeck crate documentation](https://docs.rs/brubeck/) for more information about running  the REPL and working with the library.

Please follow this repo if you're interested in the project! I'm also very keen on feedback and thoughts on what you think would be awesome to see in a RISC-V assembly playground.
